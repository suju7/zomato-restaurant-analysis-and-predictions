# zomato-restaurant-analysis-and-predictions

In this project, we will analyze the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset. For this we will:

- Get intuition about the data
- Do an exploratory data analysis
- Use graphical modules to visualize the data
- Apply a predictive point of view for helping people to choose the best restaurant.
- Using this predictive approach for predicting the success of a new restaurant in Bengaluru.

The main goal here is to predict the success (in terms of rate) for new restaurants put in Zomato service. This is very interesting for business areas to evaluate the main concepts of restaurants and customers preferences in Bengaluru region.
Also, it's helpful for new restaurants to analyze their business model and features before launching them!
